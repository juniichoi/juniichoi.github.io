		<p>In all my life as a woman—which began soon after and not unrichly—I have never known such a moment.<br> 
		Though sometimes in my brain I go back to that afternoon,<br> to relive it, <br>sail up there again toward the acoustic panels,<br> the basketball hoops,<br> and the old oak clock,<br> the careful harmonies set loose from our voices so pure and exact and light we wondered later,<br> packing up to leave,<br> how high and fast and far they had gone.</p>
